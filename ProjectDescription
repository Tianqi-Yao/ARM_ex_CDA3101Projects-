Write an ARM program that takes a string as input, then outputs a string that replaces all the vowels in the input string with 'x'.

 

Your program should give the following input prompt:

"Input a string: "

Then, your program should output the string with the vowel(s) replaced with x. Your program should terminate upon printing the output.

 

For example:

Input a string: Hello

Hxllx

"
