Write a recursive program that takes two integers as input and outputs the greatest common divisor.

Use the following algorithm:

// Given two integers m and n:

if (m < n)

        gcd(n, m) 

if n is a divisor of m

        gcd(m, n) = n

  else

        gcd (m, n) = gcd (n, m % n)
Your program must be recursive.  You must create a function that calls itself, and saves variables to the stack, and creates a stack frame. Your program should restore the stack as it returns from recursive calls.

 

Your program should have the following prompt:

"Enter Two Integers: "

Your program should then output the greatest common divisor then terminate.

 

Sample Test Cases
Enter Two Integers: 0 37
37

Enter Two Integers: 0 -37
37

Enter Two Integers: 1 37
1

Enter Two Integers: -1 37
1

Enter Two Integers: 5 75
5

Enter Two Integers: -10 -100
10

Enter Two Integers: -10 100
10

Enter Two Integers: 5 7
1

Note: gcd(0,0) will not be tested.
